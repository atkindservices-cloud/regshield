Dear Sir / Madam,
 
Gold Card Scheme for Exporters
 
Please refer to para 8.1.3 of the 
Master Circular DBR No.DIR.BC.14/04.02.002/2015-16 dated July 01, 2015
 wherein detailed instructions on ‘Gold Card Scheme for Exporters’ have been given.
 
2. We have been receiving representations from exporters and their Associations that the banks are not extending the benefits under the Gold Card Scheme as per extant instructions. It is, therefore, reiterated that the instructions relating to the Gold Card Scheme for Exporters as contained in above-mentioned Master Circular shall be strictly implemented and the branch level functionaries suitably sensitised in this regard.
 
3. Further, you are advised to give adequate publicity to the Scheme for the benefit of exporters.
 
Yours faithfully,
 
(Dr. S. K. Kar)
    Chief General Manager
